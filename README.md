Fastdevz's flexible work policy outlines remote employees' work, security, and compliance expectations. The purpose of this remote work policy is to safeguard both employees' and the organization's interests by outlining the working conditions and expectations.
##
### Who is eligible for this policy?

This policy applies to any employee whose job duties allow it. However, positions that require direct physical contact with customers (like the sales floor) are not eligible to work from home. In addition, some extenuating circumstances may post exceptions when possible.
##
### Work schedule

The employee should be available Monday to Friday from 9 AM to 3 PM on all office communication channels.
##
### Working from home (or anywhere)
#### *Team members may work from home:*

- Full-time
- Part-time (dividing daily time between the office and home)
- On pre-determined days of the week
We want to give you the chance to perform at your best - no matter where you work from.
Remote work does, however, come with a few responsibilities. So please make sure to stay available.
We do reserve the right to revoke remote working rights in cases of repeated problems.
##
### Employee rights
The eligible employee under this policy working from anywhere gets the same benefits as an office-coming employee, along with an allowance for internet charges that can be availed from the HR department.
##
### Communication
All employees should use the following channels for all official engagements for which they will be granted access:

- Slack
- Google mail
- WhatsApp
- Google Meet
##

Fastdevz will provide xx laptop, a modem, keyboard, mouse, and internet only if you are working at fastdevz offices but Working from home will requared you to have all the necessary equipments, for which the employee stated in the policy is responsible for security. The equipment needs to be password protected at all times.
##
### Security
Employee equipment should at all times be password protected. And all eligible candidates must sign the [NDA agreement attached](https://github.com/fastdevz/workplace-policies-/tree/main/Non-Disclosure%20Agreement%20(NDA)) with this policy.
##
### Compensations and benefits
The employee's compensation is determined by their role and KPI. Apart from that, all employees are eligible for learning and traveling compensation provided by Fastdevz.

##
### Tips for effectively working from home to include
* Maintain your morning routine. *
Just because you're not going into an office doesn't mean you should skip the things that ordinarily set you up for success. So wake up at the same time, and continue the routine that works for you.
## 
### Repurpose commute time for self-care
The average American commute is almost 27 minutes each way. Don't let this reclaimed time go to waste. If reading, meditating, journaling, or practicing yoga aren't currently part of your routine, now is a great time to try them out.
##
### Dress for success
Just because you can get away with wearing your PJs doesn't mean you should. You may still interact with colleagues, partners, or customers via video. Plus, dressing comfortably yet professionally helps get you in the right mindset to stay productive.
##
### Focus on nutrition
Maintain focus and energy by avoiding sugars, artificial ingredients, or empty calories. SnackNation's Work-From-Home Wellness Boxes contain a curated mix of healthier bars, chips, jerky, granola, trail mix, and sweets to keep you adequately fueled throughout your remote workdays.
##
### Designate a dedicated workspace
Find an environment that fosters productivity. It should be quiet, comfortable, and free of distractions ‚Äì and different from where you usually eat or relax.
## 
### Take time to go outside
Taking breaks is great for your focus and well-being. Recharge by walking around the block or stepping outside on a patio or balcony.
##
### Conduct as many video meetings as possible
Face-to-face interaction doesn't have to be a casualty of remote work. Conduct daily stand-ups or virtual team meetings via video conferencing software to maintain that personal connection.
## 
### Set regular work hours
It can be especially easy to let your workday creep into early mornings and evenings while working remotely. Avoid this by setting work hours and sticking to them. Don't watch TV. Working near a television inhibits our ability to concentrate. Resist the urge to have the TV on, even if it's just for background noise.
