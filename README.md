# workplace-policies-
Fastdevz's flexible work policy outlines remote employees' work, security, and compliance expectations. The purpose of this remote work policy is to safeguard both employees' and the organization's interests by outlining the working conditions and expectations.
##
### Who is eligible for this policy?

This policy applies to any employee whose job duties allow it. However, positions that require direct physical contact with customers (like the sales floor) are not eligible to work from home. In addition, some extenuating circumstances may post exceptions when possible.
##
### Work schedule

The employee should be available Monday to Friday from 9 AM to 3 PM on all office communication channels.
##
### Working from home (or anywhere)
#*Team members may work from home:*#

-Full-time
-Part-time (dividing daily time between the office and home)
-On pre-determined days of the week
We want to give you the chance to perform at your best - no matter where you work from.

Remote work does, however, come with a few responsibilities. So please make sure to stay available.

We do reserve the right to revoke remote working rights in cases of repeated problems.
